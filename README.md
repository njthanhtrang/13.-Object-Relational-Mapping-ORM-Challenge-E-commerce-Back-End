# 13. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

# Purpose
This application serves as the backend of an e-commerce site, which uses a functional Express.js API and uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

When the user adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environmental variable file, the user is able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When entering schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data. When the application is invoked, the server is started and Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database, with API GET routes for categories, products, and tags display a formatted JSON using Insomnia Core or Postman. When testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, users can create, update, and delete data in the database.

In the future, this project may be refactored for improved efficiency and readability.
